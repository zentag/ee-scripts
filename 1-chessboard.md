# Script: A sensing chessboard using magnets

### Code and project info: https://github.com/zentag/ee-sensing-chessboard

#### hook:

I have a problem. No, not an addiction or anything, but just a common scenerio that I need an elegant solution to.

I play chess, and I like to analyze games once they're finished. I also like playing on a physical board. Those two don't go so well together.

#### potential solutions:

- writing moves
  - using algebraic
  - takes time to write & input to pc
- inputing to pc
  - takes the whole point out
- buying something premade
  - expensive
  - fun & learning

#### what I chose

- ESP32

  - familiarity
  - wifi

- magnets

  - hall effect sensor
  - under each square

- 3d printing
  - cheap at library
  - models available
  - easy to customize
